<h3> One of the wonderful things about living in Alaska is the Summer. And the best thing about the summer is Hiking. There are hundreds of trails ranging from a couple mile walks to hikes and moutain climbs. This site will share some of my favorite hikes in the Anchorage area. This means any hike that you can drive to in less than an hour and half. This includes all of Anchorage, north to Palmer and Wasilla and south to Girdwood and Portage.  It is by no means a complete list, but will give you a start to some wonderful adventures. These are all hikes I have completed and enjoyed. Pick the type of hike you wish to try and then pick the best choice for you.</h3>
