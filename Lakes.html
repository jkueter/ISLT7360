<h3>If you are looking for an adventure more than just a hike, maybe heading to a lake for some water fun might be a good choice for you.  This way you can make two adventures into one.  Just a warning, the temperatures of our lakes can range from cold to very cold, so make sure you have layers to wear when you are done.  Brining some water shoes can also be helpful as the lake bottoms are often soft.</h3>
