<h3>Mountain hikes take you to the tops of the peaks and allow amazing views of the Anchorage bowl. These hikes range from medium to challenging, but if you have the ability, it is worth the effort and the time. There is no better feeling than standing at the top of a mountain looking down on the city below.</h3> <br>
